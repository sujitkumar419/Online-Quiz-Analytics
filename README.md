# 📊 Online Quiz Analytics Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a dirty online quiz dataset (200+ records, 20 columns) to perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), ranking, and performance insights using Python.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps
- Removed duplicate records
- Handled missing values (mean/median imputation)
- Converted incorrect data types
- Standardized inconsistent categorical values
- Removed unrealistic values (invalid ages)
- Cleaned feedback and score columns

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
- Score distribution analysis
- Pass vs Fail comparison
- Gender-wise performance
- City-wise average score
- Device impact on performance
- Time vs Score relationship
- Feedback rating analysis
- Correlation heatmap

---

## 🏆 Advanced Features
- Rank generation system
- Top 10 and Bottom 10 student comparison
- Performance categorization:
  - High Performer
  - Average Performer
  - At Risk
- Individual student performance tracking

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Higher scores often correlate with better feedback ratings.
- Device type shows slight performance variation.
- Time spent does not guarantee higher scores.
- Ranking system identifies top and at-risk students effectively.
